	1. [ provide background on the number 0, then ] why
	   was was the discovery of 0 important for number 
	   theory?

	2. [ provide background on how Pythagoreans did not
	     even consider 1 to be a number. ]
	   What do 0 and 1 have in common?
	   (Hint: this is a question about identities.)

	3. Regarding Fibonacci, it's interesting that we now 
	   think of the naturals as an inductive structure,
	   because Fibonacci understood the idea of recursion.
	   Was Fibonacci's work predictive of our modern concept
	   of the naturals as inductive, or is this ( looking at 
	   old math using a contemporary lens )

	4. Can you tell us about the Russel-Zermalo Paradox and its
	   importance to the history of mathematics?

	5. How do modern Number Theorists think about the C in ZFC?
	   Does it have significant number-theoretic consequences?
	   And what is it?

	6. [ some history of negative numbers, then ] Mathematicians
	   found negative numbers to be intuitively absurd.  Why did
	   negative numbers matter to mathematics?

	7. Do you think that negative numbers exist in the same way 
	   that positive numbers do?  Why?  [ apple explanation ]

	   - possibly compare to matter/antimatter, charge/negative charge

	8. Why is it that the Integers form a ring, but the Naturals do not?

	9. What is the significance of the fact that the Integers form a ring,
	    but the Naturals do not?

	10. Does a ring add structure to a set?

	11. Under what circumstances do number systems break down?
		- e.g., the one where forall x, z, exists a s.t. x * a = z
		        in which case exists a s.t. 0 * a = 1, causing big issues ...s
		- e.g., Theory of Triplets

	12. [ The Russell-Zermelo paradox history ]
		Zermalo-Frankel Set Theory solves the Russel-Zermalo paradox by
	    saying that a set cannot contain itself.
	    This trick simply outlaws the single example that would otherwise
	    ruin the logical system.
	    How does this axiomatic approach compare to the construction of the
	    rationals?

	13. [ have Bryden give explanation of how the rationals are equivalence
	      classes ]
		
		[ The idea that equivalence classes and equivalence relations are 
	      *the same thing* was not generally understood until the 1940s.
	      Prior to that, mathematicians re-invented classes over and over,
	      each time inventing new terms for the same idea, like "class",
	      "category", and "block".  They also re-invented equivalence
	      relations under different names, such as "similarity relations". ]
	     
	     Clearly the modern concept of equivalence fundamentally changes
	     how we view the rationals.
	     Does it have a similar impact on how we view other mathematical
	     objects?

	14. [ Bryden introduces the concept of a field ]
	    So in a ring we had additive inverses, and now with a field, we also
	    have multiplicative inverses.
	    Is addition fundamentally different from multiplication?

	    [ example: system where addition is * and multiplication is exponent ]

	15. You had a frusterating experience in grade-school when your math teacher
	    insisted that 1 is not the same thing as .99bar.
	    Can you tell us about this?

	16. [ prior to Real numbers ]
	    Can you tell us about Cauchy, and his discovery of the limit?
	    Can you give us the intuition behind Cauchy's (epsilon, delta)-definition?

	17. [ prior to Real numbers ]
	    We got the ring structure by closing the holes caused by addition, and
	    we got the field structure by closing the holes caused by multiplication.
	    What happens when we close the holes caused by limits?
	    For example, what happens when we close the holes caused by limits in the
	    Rationals?

	18. [ after Bryden gives the real numbers ]
	    When you move from the Rationals to the Reals, what features emerge, 
	    convenient or bizarre?

	19. [ Bryden says that next, we should discuss p-adic numbers ]
	    
	    [ Bryden defines the p-adic numbers ]
	    
	    [ I give a brief history of p-adic numbers, including the 
	      stuff about the debate on the history of equivalence classes ]
	    
	    [ I ask bryden to what extent the discovery of the p-adic numbers
	       was inevitable ]
	    
	    [ Bryden discusses the theory of Alexander Ostrowski, saying that
	      this theory is the *only* way to fill in the holes in Q;
	      so even if you discovered the holes while studying something
	      else entirely, if you tried yo fill them in, you'd need to 
	      discover p-adic numbers ]

	20. We were just talking about rings and fields.
	    Do the p-adic numbers contain some operational structure, like a ring
	    or a field?

	    [ then bryden explains how Zp = { q in Qp : |q| <= 1 } is a ring ]

	21. What are the p-adic numbers good for?

	( concluding question )

	22. Where does the name "p-adic" come from?

	23. [ If Bryden hasn't explained who Hilbert is and what his problems are,
	      ask him to do so, then ... ]
	     Some of Hilbert's problems remain unsolved today.
	     Do you foresee the invention of new number systems in order to solve 
	     any of these problems?

	     What about the Clay Foundation problems?
